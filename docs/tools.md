# Available Tools

This document describes the tools that Claude Code can use when interacting through the Telegram bot. Tools are the operations Claude performs behind the scenes to read, write, search, and execute code on your behalf.

## Overview

By default, the bot allows **17 tools**, configured via the `CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS` environment variable. Tool calls are validated before they run by the `can_use_tool` callback in [`src/claude/sdk_integration.py`](../src/claude/sdk_integration.py), which refuses tools outside the allowed list and checks file paths and Bash commands against the `APPROVED_DIRECTORY`.

When Claude uses a tool during a conversation, the tool name appears in real-time if verbose output is enabled (`/verbose 1` or `/verbose 2`). A tool call that is not allowed, or that fails a boundary check, is denied before it executes, and Claude is told why.

## Tool Reference

### File Operations

| Tool | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Read** | 📖 | Read file contents from disk. Supports text files, images, PDFs, and Jupyter notebooks. |
| **Write** | ✏️ | Create a new file or overwrite an existing file with new contents. |
| **Edit** | ✏️ | Perform targeted string replacements within an existing file without rewriting the entire file. |
| **MultiEdit** | ✏️ | Apply multiple edits to a single file in one operation. Useful for making several changes at once. |

### Search & Navigation

| Tool | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Glob** | 🔍 | Find files by name pattern (e.g., `**/*.py`, `src/**/*.ts`). Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time. |
| **Grep** | 🔍 | Search file contents using regular expressions. Supports filtering by file type or glob pattern, context lines, and multiple output modes. |
| **LS** | 📂 | List directory contents. |

### Execution

| Tool | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Bash** | 💻 | Execute shell commands (e.g., `git`, `npm`, `pytest`, `make`). Subject to directory boundary enforcement and, in classic mode, dangerous-pattern blocking. |

### Notebooks

| Tool | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **NotebookRead** | 📓 | Read a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) and return all cells with their outputs. |
| **NotebookEdit** | 📓 | Replace, insert, or delete cells in a Jupyter notebook. |

### Web

| Tool | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **WebFetch** | 🌐 | Fetch a URL and process its content. HTML is converted to markdown before analysis. |
| **WebSearch** | 🌐 | Search the web and return results. Useful for looking up documentation, current events, or information beyond Claude's training data. |

### Task Management

| Tool | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **TodoRead** | ☑️ | Read the current task list that Claude uses to track multi-step work. |
| **TodoWrite** | ☑️ | Create or update a task list to plan and track progress on complex operations. |

### Agent Orchestration

| Tool | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Task** | 🧠 | Launch a sub-agent to handle complex, multi-step operations autonomously. The sub-agent runs with its own context and returns a result when finished. |
| **TaskOutput** | 🧠 | Read the output of a background sub-agent launched by **Task**. Required for retrieving results from agents that were run in the background. |
| **Skill** | 🔧 | Run a Claude Code skill (a packaged set of instructions) that is available to the session. |

## Verbose Output

When verbose output is enabled, each tool call is shown with its icon as Claude works:

```
You: Add type hints to utils.py

Bot: Working... (5s)
     📖 Read: utils.py
     💬 I'll add type annotations to all functions
     ✏️ Edit: utils.py
     💻 Bash: uv run mypy src/utils.py
Bot: [Claude shows the changes and type-check results]
```

Control verbosity with `/verbose`:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `/verbose 0` | Final response only (typing indicator stays active) |
| `/verbose 1` | Tool names + reasoning snippets (default) |
| `/verbose 2` | Tool names with input details + longer reasoning text |

## Configuration

### Allowing / Disallowing Tools

The default allowed tools list is defined in `src/config/settings.py` and can be overridden with environment variables:

```bash
# Allow only specific tools (comma-separated)
CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS=Read,Write,Edit,Bash,Glob,Grep,LS,Task,TaskOutput,MultiEdit,NotebookRead,NotebookEdit,WebFetch,TodoRead,TodoWrite,WebSearch

# Explicitly block specific tools (comma-separated, takes precedence over allowed)
CLAUDE_DISALLOWED_TOOLS=Bash,Write
```

The filesystem tools (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookRead`, `NotebookEdit`) and `Bash` are
deliberately not pre-approved when they are passed to the SDK, so every call reaches the
boundary checks below. Any tool that is not in `CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS` is refused. To allow the
tools of an MCP server, add `mcp__<server>` (or `mcp__<server>__*`) or the individual
`mcp__<server>__<tool>` names. No MCP tool is allowed by default.

Allow rules in Claude Code settings files are also honored. The SDK loads only the `project`
setting source unless `CLAUDE_LOAD_USER_SETTINGS=true`, which adds the `user` source. The
boundary checks below also run as an SDK `PreToolUse` hook, which Claude Code calls on every
tool call. An allow rule for a guarded tool therefore does not skip them. Neither does the
`permissionMode` frontmatter of a project or user agent definition (`.claude/agents/`), which
Claude Code applies to the subagents that definition starts. A tool outside the guarded set that
is pre-approved by an allow rule, or used by such a subagent, is not checked against
`CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS`. The bridge starts Claude
Code in the `default` permission mode, so `permissions.defaultMode` in those files (for
example `bypassPermissions`) does not skip the checks. Tool calls cannot write
them: Claude Code configuration (anything in a `.claude` directory, such as settings, hooks,
skills, commands and agents, plus `.claude.json`, `.mcp.json` and the user config directory)
is read-only to Claude, inside the approved directory too and whatever the letter case.

To allow all tools without name-based validation:

```bash
# Skip tool allow/disallow checks (path and bash safety checks still apply)
DISABLE_TOOL_VALIDATION=true
```

### Security Layers

Even when a tool is allowed, additional security checks apply. The exact checks depend on the run mode:

1. **File path validation** (all modes) — `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookRead` and `NotebookEdit` operations must target paths within the `APPROVED_DIRECTORY`. Path traversal attempts are blocked before the tool runs.

2. **Bash command validation** (classic mode only) — Dangerous patterns (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, `chmod 777`, pipes, redirections, subshells) are blocked by default. Filesystem-modifying commands (`mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, etc.) must target paths within the approved directory. This layer is **not active in agentic mode**, which relies on OS-level sandboxing instead.

3. **Bash directory boundary checks** (all modes) — Filesystem-modifying commands and output redirections are checked before they run to ensure their target paths stay within the approved directory, regardless of run mode. The check follows `cd`, `~`/`$HOME`, `sh -c` and quoted paths in inline interpreter code. Sandboxed Bash is not auto-approved, so the check also runs when the sandbox is enabled, and Bash may not ask to leave the sandbox (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox` is refused). `SANDBOX_EXCLUDED_COMMANDS` is empty by default: a command line that contains an excluded command runs outside the sandbox as a whole, so a line that joins one with other commands is refused (see SECURITY.md). With `SANDBOX_ENABLED=false` this static check is the only Bash control, and it is not a boundary.

4. **Audit logging** (all modes) — All tool calls and security violations are recorded for review.

See [Security](../SECURITY.md) for the full security model.
